# hello-world

Hi there,

the GitHub Beginners Tutorial send me here...
I'm Max and I started coding with the visual programming language Grasshopper for Rhino 3D, as I'm an architect. I also write some python scripts to make my job easier. In my free time, I like to experiment with the RaspberryPi and the Arduino.
